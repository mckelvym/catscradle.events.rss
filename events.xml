      <description><![CDATA[Cat's Cradle Presents<br/><br/>Wednesday, May 20 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Haw River Ballroom<br/><br/>Over the past 20 years, The New Pornographers have proven themselves one of the most excellent bands in indie rock. They have released nine studio albums, including their classic debut Mass Romantic and their latest 2023’s Continue as a Guest, which marked their debut for Merge Records.<br/>They’ve constantly offered new sonic surprises with every album, and have established themselves alongside modern luminaries like Yo La Tengo and Superchunk when it comes to their ability to evolve while still retaining what made them so special in the first place. Of the newest record, New York Magazine lauded, “The New Pornographers are a massive unit bursting with unique and intersecting talents…the band’s ninth album serves another helping of their signature dish.”<br/>The band’s new single “Ballad of the Last Payphone” is out now with a new full-length album slated for release in 2026 – more details to come.<br/>Critical acclaim for The New Pornographers:<br/>“Over the course of their 20-plus-year career, the New Pornographers have often specialized in catchy ambiguity. If leader Carl Newman was just a machine cranking out power-pop tunes, it would get boring. But there’s also a lot of mixed emotions going on under the surface of their studiously nuanced pop-rock formalism—like if Cheap Trick was as quick-witted as Steely Dan, or the Romantics were as thoughtful as R.E.M.” – Rolling Stone<br/>“Pure, blissfully irresistible power pop” – NPR Music<br/>“[The New Pornographers] make catchy, sophisticated alternate-universe hits.” – Stereogum]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Orca<br/><br/>Tuesday, January 20 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>In the kaleidoscopic world of music, 54 Ultra emerges as a beacon of sonic fusion, weaving synthy indie rock with a Latin soul heartbeat. Based out of New Jersey, 54 Ultra is the musical project of songwriter and producer JohnAnthony (Johnny) Rodriguez. Offering music that is both honest and melodic, with a charismatic stage presence to match, 54 Ultra is carving out a space uniquely his own, defined by a garage pop and soul sound.<br/>Through a combination of interning in a New Jersey studio and self-teaching, Johnny built a solid foundation in music production before stepping into the spotlight with his own artist project. In early 2025, Johnny headed to Miami to work with Kali Uchis on her latest album, Sincerely, where he produced the track “All I Can Say.”<br/>In 2024, he shared his debut single, “Where Are You,” which quickly gained traction online, introducing listeners to a sound that feels both timeless and fresh. A year later, he released his debut EP First Works, which Billboard named one of the Best Projects of the Year (So Far). The six-track collection features fan favorites like “Upside Down” and “No Tengo Valor”, and was followed by four sold-out shows in New York and Los Angeles.<br/>Most recently, 54 Ultra shared “I Won’t Go,” a Spanglish synth ballad that further showcases his ability to blend emotional depth with vibrant, genre-blurring soundscapes.<br/>Just a little over a year after releasing his first single, it was announced that 54 Ultra will perform at Coachella 2026. Leading up to the festival, he will be opening for Kali Uchis at her San Jose show, embarking on a nearly sold-out North American tour, and playing his first European headline shows in London, Amsterdam, and Paris, before closing out the year with a performance at Festival Color Caribe in Puerto Rico.<br/>Website | Instagram | TikTok | Facebook | YouTube | Spotify]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[supermutt, Autumn House<br/><br/>Thursday, January 29 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Johnny Sunrise (and the Clouds) Hailing from Western Massachusetts, and now based in Carrboro, NC, Johnny Sunrise is an indie folk rock singer-songwriter who draws inspiration from love, longing, the “quarter-life crisis,” and the uncertainty of life. Although Johnny grew up with music primarily as a drummer, his unforeseen travels up and down the east coast and the isolation caused by the COVID pandemic brought him closer to his neglected guitar. Johnny is now joined by the uber-talented trio Marco “Paco” Marvelli (lap steel), Gabby Messner (bass), and Jake Richter (drums) whose contributions take the live show to another level. Johnny has carved a place in the NC triangle music scene over the past couple of years performing original songs with honest lyrics and a soulful voice. Always with a smile and a healthy dose of banter.<br/>Supermutt Supermutt is a femme-foward indie collective based out of Durham and Raleigh, NC. The five piece ensemble – Mimi, Ali, Jaz, Katie, and Jacks — crafts sonic tapestries where narrative-driven songwriting meets lush, atmospheric arrangements built from cascading vocal harmonies and dreamlike instrumentation.<br/>The band’s dynamic sound thrives in the tension between contradiction and cohesion, embracing calculated dissonance and textural experimentation while maintaining an unshakable foundation in melodic harmony. This approach creates music that feels both intimately grounded and expansively otherworldly, inviting listeners into carefully constructed emotional worlds where vulnerability and strength coexist.<br/>Autumn House Autumn House is a country-inflected alternative rock band based in Carrboro, NC drawing influence from such artists as Neil Young, Lucinda Williams, and Jason Molina, as well as some of the noisier alt-rock bands of the 90s like Chapel Hill’s own Archers of Loaf. Their songs, ranging from wistful ballads to full-throated rockers, deal broadly with the ephemeral and the beauty in the mundane. Autumn House is comprised of Cole Cook (bass) Paco Marvelli (lap steel guitar), Max Randall (guitar, vocals), and Andy Seiglie (drums, backing vocals).]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Thursday, February 05 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>Fancy Gap is a duo formed by Stuart McLamb (The Love Language) and Charles Crossingham, whose musical bond was forged during the pandemic in a mountain cabin in Fancy Gap, Virginia. Blending elements of country, pop, and classic rock, their sound draws from a wide range of influences, from ‘90s radio rock to timeless Americana. Their music captures the raw emotion of love, loss, and life’s fleeting moments, often with a nostalgic, free-spirited vibe. With an authentic, hands-on approach to songwriting and recording, Fancy Gap’s chemistry shines through in every note, inviting listeners on a heartfelt journey.<br/>Website | Instagram | Facebook | TikTok | Spotify<br/>Creating in a state of constant adventure, Asheville, NC-based Lua Flora has successfully unified sounds that typically don’t go together. Led by the expressive and intentional pen of songwriter Evan Button, the “roots pop” act seamlessly blends Americana, pop, and indie folk with the rhythmic undercurrents of Caribbean and West African traditions, crafting songs that feel both deeply personal and universally resonant. Taking the show from backyard parties to national stages, Lua Flora has supported artists like Satsang, Franc Moody, Arise Roots, and more, while appearing at festivals such as FloydFest, Rooster Walk, and Shakori Hills. Further cementing their reputation as a rising force in contemporary songwriting, Lua Flora recently released a collaborative single with singer-songwriter Brett Dennen, marking a milestone moment that underscores the project’s heart-first approach and growing influence in the modern folk landscape.<br/>“The musical embodiment of Asheville’s creative spirit” -Face The Current “…easy and melodic — a light, laidback recluse from the grind.” -Top Shelf Music<br/>Website | Instagram | Facebook | TikTok | YouTube]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Friday, February 27 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Born in Alabama and baptized in the dive bars of the southeast, Paul McDonald first made noise with the Grand Magnolias, a roots-rock outfit, before catching fire in the public eye during American Idol’s 2011 run.<br/>When the bright lights blurred and the cameras turned, the man behind the voice slipped into the shadows where he did what real artists do: He lived, he lost, and he wrote. Retreating to Nashville, that holy city of reinvention, Paul stitched himself back together with worn boots, hard songs, and a new band called the Mourning Doves.<br/>Now, in 2025, the giant has stirred with the release of “So Long to the Dark Side” – a gospel-tinged reckoning wrapped in cosmic Americana and lit with songs that sound like they were scribbled on the edge of a breakdown and sung back from the brink. Raised on Petty, Parsons, and pain, Paul McDonald is not chasing trends, he’s conjuring something older and truer. His live performances are equal parts revival and rock séance.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | YouTube]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Saturday, February 28 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>The story of Nep begins in Daytona, Florida, a place of endless motorcycle rallies, sticky summers, and the kind of small-town culture she always knew she’d leave behind. Growing up surrounded by Bike Week and Biketoberfest, she felt both shaped and alienated by the noise of her hometown. “Beaches are fucked, Daytona sucks,” she sings on Biketoberfest, mocking and mourning the place that raised her.<br/>It’s that push and pull, the desire to escape and the need to memorialize, that fuels her debut album, Noelle. Written during her senior year at the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music, Nep crafted the record with her best friend and collaborator Jake Sonderman. Between classes, late-night studio sessions, and college parties that often bled into the lyrics themselves, the pair built an album that feels both diaristic and cinematic: raw experience refracted through sharp, infectious indie-pop.<br/>Each track on Noelle pulls from a different corner of Nep’s lived experience and explores a different sonic palette. All Around Beauty captures the heartbreak of running into an ex at a college party, blue tongues, Jell-O shots, tears in the bathroom. The title track, Noelle, sets aching strings against lyrics of rage and betrayal: “I was a kid / You were a guy / It’s not fair / I was a girl.” Black Car begins as a delicate piano ballad before erupting into a punk track with a heavy metal guitar solo, memorializing a summer defined by grief and family rituals. Scar leans into a bluegrass inspired folk arrangement that detonates into a harsh rock ending, tracing the way friendships can wound and mark us permanently. By the album’s end, July opens into a big band sound with horns dominating the track & points toward renewal: “I think I might love life again.” The final track, Florida Girl, closes the record with an anthem of self realization, a defiant chant that reclaims her roots while refusing to be defined by them.<br/>Nep has been building an audience for years, long before any records were even finished. Short clips and demos posted to TikTok racked up over 5 million likes, drawing fans to her mix of sardonic humor, brutal honesty, and a quirky charm that makes even her darkest songs feel oddly uplifting. She quickly translated that online energy to the stage, selling out early headline shows in Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago, and touring alongside Ricky Montgomery, mxmtoon, and Grent Perez.<br/>With the release of Noelle, Nep is not just putting out an album; she’s leaving Florida behind. After years of translating Daytona’s beaches, bike rallies, and heartbreak into song, she’s moving to Los Angeles, a new chapter, a new landscape.<br/>Even so, traces of home are everywhere in her songs: in the defiance of Florida Girl (“You can never break a Florida girl”), in the humor and heartbreak of I Will Always Love You, Alright, and in the unflinching intimacy of The Soundtrack.<br/>Noelle is both an origin story and an emancipation. It documents the mess of youth and the catharsis of finally walking away. In Nep’s world, scars become anthems, heartbreak becomes punchlines, and growing up in Daytona becomes the stuff of unforgettable songs.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | YouTube | TikTok | Soundcloud | Spotify]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Six Foot Blonde<br/><br/>Friday, March 06 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>For The Nude Party, nearly a decade has flown by in the blink of an eye. In that time, the New York-based band has released a pair of well-received albums, an EP, and played countless shows. Prior to the pandemic, the band was really starting to hit its stride. They had a system in place and were spreading their brand of melodic rock to the masses. In fact, they could count Jack White, Arctic Monkeys, and Orville Peck as vocal supporters, which led to support slots for each. Soon, incredible live appearances at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Newport Folk Festival, and Shaky Knees became the norm.<br/>Over the course of the last two years, The Nude Party decided to produce their new album, Rides On, themselves. With the help of Matthew Horner, The Nude Party had as much fun creating as they ever had at any other point in their career. Their new album includes 14 songs that dabble in electro-pop and stripped-down country. The Nude Party coalesced and embraced the spirit of collaboration. They’re excited to begin the next chapter of their career.<br/>At a time when it would have been easy to pack it in, the band continues to persevere.<br/>Website | Instagram | Facebook | YouTube | TikTok | Spotify]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[andmoreagain presents<br/><br/>Saturday, March 07 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>Dirtwire stands poised between ancient Mother Earth and modern technology, a blend of ethnomusicology and the psychedelic trance state, gut-bucket delta blues and what the band variously dubs “back-porch space cowboy blues, swamptronica, and electro-twang.” It’s a sound informed by Dirtwire’s travels and performances around the globe, where East meets West and North joins South. From the favelas in Brazil, Femi Kuti’s Shrine in Lagos, Tokyo’s bluegrass clubs, Ayahuasca ceremonies in Central America, Gamelan performances in Bali, desert festivals in the Australian Outback, and the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan’s modernized new capital Astana, the band spreads its message by building bridges across musical cultures in their own unique way.<br/>Dirtwire plays an array of instruments both ancient and modern, including West African kamale ngonis, jaw harps, space fiddles, whamola basses, Rickenbacher electric 12 string guitars, bowed Banjos and mouth harps from around the globe, all interwoven into modern laptop beat creation. Hailing from the underground west coast electronic bass music scene Dirtwire finds itself at the forefront of experimental electronic music production mixing in their wide array of world instruments with sampled beats and 808’s. Dirtwire’s live shows are a communal psychedelic journey, ranging from down home boot stomping get downs, to bass and blues electronic mashups, to ethereal cinematic beat driven soundscapes. Woven into each is the exploration of where live instruments meet computer production, and where tradition meets experimentation.<br/>Website | Spotify | Instagram | Bandcamp | YouTube | Facebook]]></description>

Originally from South-London, currently based in Atlanta; Puma Blue first gained wider attention with his EPs Swum Baby (2017) & Blood Loss (2018). His debut album In Praise Of Shadows was released in 2021, followed by concert-film ‘A Late Night Special’. Noted for a blend of sensuality, intimate fragility & haunting, nocturnal ambience, Puma Blue’s live shows feature a band of close friends, blending jazz-influenced improvisation with a vocal energy often likened to Jeff Buckley. His second album Holy Waters, a darker, band-focused meditation on the acceptance of death, was released in 2023 & hailed a triumph. In 2025 it was followed by surprise album, antichamber, announced mere hours before release, an ambient, stripped-back body of work featuring obscure, minimalist arrangements & field recordings. In October 2025, Puma Blue announced that new music was once again imminent, sharing fragments of new single ‘Desire’ – set for release on 22nd October 2025.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | Soundcloud]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Friday, March 13 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Surfing for Daisy’s sound flows like the tides of Asbury Park – smooth, soothing, yet unpredictable. The guitars undulate like ocean waves, calm and hypnotic one moment, crashing with raw energy the next. With rhythms that pulse like the sea, and vocal harmonies that announce the sunrise – their music balances serene lulls with bursts of righteous clamor, capturing both the tranquility and wildness of the coast. Each song is a journey, where moments of quiet beauty give way to sonic storms. Their sound is a reminder that life, like the ocean, is ever changing – a mix of peace and chaos, flowing together in perfect harmony.<br/>Website | Facebook | TikTok | YouTube | Instagram]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[andmoreagain presents<br/><br/>Saturday, March 14 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Everything about TWEN is hands-on. Ian produces, engineers, and mixes their albums. Jane designs every visual element, from videos, to posters, to merch. They’ve screen-printed their own shirts, booked their own tours, edited their own films, and built their tour van into a full-time mobile home. Their 2022 LP One Stop Shop wasn’t just a title, it was the truth. Even now, as their reach has expanded to a sold-out Red Rocks Amphitheatre show, opening arena tours, and having played 500+ shows across North America and Europe, they’ve kept full control. It’s proof you can exist outside the system and still make something that is current and alive.<br/>“TWEN, named after a post-war German magazine; a slang term for people in their twenties, has a sound that’s at once modern and nostalgic. Per the band, it’s ‘1965, 1995 and 2025 all at the same time.'” – Jax Today<br/>Written across highways & coastlines, their latest LP ‘Fate Euphoric’ isn’t nostalgic, though it nods to Britpop, psych, and new wave. It sounds more like the past filtered through the noise of right now. If ‘One Stop Shop’pointed out the problems of the 2020s from a first person perspective, ‘Fate Euphoric’ takes a bird’s-eye view, seeking comfort in the cosmic wheel that will always keep spinning. TWEN are a band in flux, and that’s the point. The van is still home, but the studio is wherever the signal feels right. The fate might be uncertain, but for now, it’s euphoric.<br/>Fate Euphoric is available on election day, November 4, 2025 via the band’s own label Twenterprises.<br/>Website | Instagram | Facebook | Youtube | Spotify | Bandcamp | TikTok]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Monday, March 16 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>And Your Song is Like a Circle, the second album from New York-based artist Skullcrusher, a.k.a. Helen Ballentine, winds its way into an everchanging, unstable core. Recorded piecemeal over a period of years following the release of her celebrated 2022 debut, Quiet the Room, And Your Song is Like a Circle does not capture experience – it gestures toward the imprint of an experience that is uncapturable. Swaying between vaporous folk and crystalline electronics, landing somewhere in the snowfields shared by Grouper and Julia Holter, Circle probes the ways that grief turns itself inside out. Loss itself becomes as real and substantial as what’s been lost.<br/>Ballentine began writing Circle after leaving Los Angeles, a city she’d called home for nearly a decade. She ended up returning upstate to New York’s Hudson Valley, where she was born and raised. Several years of intense isolation followed, and Ballentine immersed herself in films, books, and art that reflected the rupture of relocating cross-country and its dissociative aftershocks.<br/>Throughout the record, the line between human and machine blurs. On “Maelstrom,” voices crash between echoing drumbeats like water through a cavern. The vocal filigrees on “Exhale” fan out into a haze of synthesizers and strings. “Dragon” lets piano echo over tight, gritted percussion.<br/>If Skullcrusher’s first album rendered the detailed intimacies of domestic space, Circle finds itself vaporized across the landscape: swirling, drifting, searching. It skirts an event horizon in long, slow strokes. These are songs that vibrate with the fervency of an attempt to capture a moment, to draw a circle around it. “I like thinking about my work as a collection,” Ballentine says. “Eventually it might form a circle. Each time I make something, I’m putting another line around the body of work. It feels like I’ll be trying to trace it for my whole life.”<br/>Website | Facebook | TikTok | Instagram]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Friday, April 24 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>In a world where authenticity is often sacrificed, Krooked Kings stand as a beacon of unabashed vulnerability and raw emotion. Their indie rock sound is a candid reflection of their influences, drawing from the ornate and biting guitar arrangements of The Strokes, the introspective depth of Bon Iver, and the easygoing charm of Peach Pit. But while these inspirations shape their musical foundation, it’s the band’s own narrative that sets them apart.<br/>At the heart of Krooked Kings’ music is a brutally honest portrayal of the twenty-something experience in America—capturing the restlessness, dreams, and disillusionments of a generation navigating the complexities of modern life. Their lyrics resonate with the tumultuous yet exhilarating journey of coming of age, making each song a poignant and relatable exploration of life’s ups and downs.<br/>Krooked Kings burst onto the scene with a fervor that quickly captivated audiences across Europe and North America, culminating in a debut tour that left an indelible mark on their fans. Their ability to connect on a profound level is evident not just in their packed shows but also in their impressive digital footprint. With over 70 million streams on their albums, their music has reverberated across the globe, cementing their status as a rising force in indie rock.<br/>Their presence isn’t just isolated to the realm of underground fans and loyal listeners, having gained critical acclaim and placements on some of Spotify’s most sought after playlists in the genre including “Today’s Indie Rock”, “Feel Good Indie Rock”, “Marrow”, and many more.<br/>With their fearless approach to songwriting and an ever-expanding fanbase, they’re poised to redefine the boundaries of indie rock and make their mark on the world stage.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | TikTok]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Wednesday, April 29 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Arts Fishing Club is more than just a band; they are storytellers, explorers of the human condition, and purveyors of living life boldly. An ethos demonstrated by frontman Christopher Kessenich’s first 4.5 month tour in which he walked 1600 miles along the east coast from Maine to Atlanta to Nashville, played 60 shows, and slept in strangers’ living room floors. The boldness that compelled such an adventure is felt in AFC’s electrifying live shows where the band weaves the raw energy of rock and the introspective lyrical honesty of folk to create a sound that is timeless and refreshingly original. Whether performing in sold out small clubs or on festival stages (Bonnaroo, Summerfest, Treefort, Mile of Music), their engaging stage presence and ability to connect with fans makes their live performances a cornerstone of their success. With a growing fanbase, commitment to pushing their creative boundaries, and an infectiously entertaining live show, Arts Fishing Club is poised to make a lasting impact on the indie music landscape.<br/>Website | Instagram | Facebook | Spotify | YouTube]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Sunday, May 17 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>With Improvement Movement<br/>Iron & Wine is the musical project of singer-songwriter Sam Beam. Born and raised in South Carolina, Beam is a former film professor who got his start making home recordings before landing on Sub Pop Records. Iron & Wine’s 2002 debut, The Creek Drank the Cradle garnered both critical and popular acclaim, vaulting Beam into the spotlight of the burgeoning indie-folk/Americana scene as one of its new and leading voices.<br/>For over 20 years, Iron & Wine has captured the emotion and imagination of listeners with distinctly cinematic songs. His recorded output includes seven full-length studio records, collaborations with Calexico, Ben Bridwell (Band of Horses), and Jesca Hoop, countless EP’s, singles and compilation/soundtrack appearances, a live concert documentary, and five GRAMMY nominations.<br/>Iron & Wine’s latest record, Light Verse was released in April 2024 with Paste Magazine noting “… Beam returns with an expanded sonic palette while also rekindling the bright spark that made 2007’s The Shepherd’s Dog so magical.”<br/>Website | Instagram | Facebook | YouTube | Spotify]]></description>
