      <description><![CDATA[Wild Oak, Pollen<br/><br/>Thursday, January 22 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>The John Wood Band is a soulful, six-piece indie rock band out of Wilmington, NC. The band formed at UNCW, led by lead singer and songwriter John Wood, who is known for songs such as Coffee On The Beach and Dry Eyes. With six pieces in the band, you can always expect a dynamic and electric set. They have played alongside acts such as Congress The Band, Winyah, Harvey Street, Innlet, The Vegabonds, Wim Tapley, and Easy Honey. Catch The John Wood Band on tour all year long!<br/>Instagram | Spotify<br/>Wild Oak is an indie rock band out of Chapel Hill, NC. Battling through noise complaints and cop visits, the band played their first gig in February of 2025. With a sound somewhere between the Backseat Lovers and Ax and the Hatchetmen, Wild Oak hits the stage each night, sharing one thing with the audience: love for music.<br/>Pollen is an indie/alt-rock band based in Chapel Hill, NC. Formed when a casual invite to play, evolved into the first practice. The name Pollen comes from hours spent practicing outside, each time ending with the band covered in yellow dust. Drawing inspiration from staple bands like The Red Hot Chili Peppers and blending in the fresh, melodic edge of modern indie rock, Pollen is slowly cementing themselves in the vibrant Chapel Hill live music scene. They aim to bring the energy and fun of a cramped house show to every venue they play.]]></description>
