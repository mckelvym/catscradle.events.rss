      <description><![CDATA[Rhineland<br/><br/>Saturday, February 21 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Since 2016, Vacation Manor combine an artful blend of eloquent lyricism, alternative experimentation, indie rock energy, and unassuming pop appeal. The duo—Nathan Towles [guitar, vocals] and Cole Young [drums]—have earned acclaim from American Songwriter, Atwood, and more. Now, they pull fans deeper into their embrace on their 2025 EP [Nettwerk].<br/>“We value people above all,” adds Nathan. “For us, our music is always better when we can involve our good friends in the process and experience something together. That in and of itself feels like a success for us.”<br/>This community grasped onto the music and never let go. Vacation Manor emerged with the Girl, Say EP highlighted by “Careless” and the breakout “A Toast and a Spirit.” The pair progressed over the course of Everything I Can’t Say Out Loud [2019] and Vacation Manor [2021]. Along the way, they toured alongside Briston Maroney and Night Traveler, in addition to performing at festivals such as Bright Shade Music & Arts Festival. The guys carefully assembled what would become the EP over two years. This time around, songs represented “different landmarks” in their shared and individual experiences. Recording out of a home studio in Virginia, Nathan and Cole self-produced the tracks, nodding to inspirations a la Oasis and The Sundays.<br/>In the end, Vacation Manor’s community will only continue to grow. “With anything we put out, we want to give people language to the things that they’re experiencing too,” Nathan leaves off. “It’s a way for us all to process life.”<br/>Website | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Cat's Cradle Presents<br/><br/>Wednesday, May 20 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Haw River Ballroom<br/><br/>Over the past 20 years, The New Pornographers have proven themselves one of the most excellent bands in indie rock. They have released nine studio albums, including their classic debut Mass Romantic and their latest 2023’s Continue as a Guest, which marked their debut for Merge Records.<br/>They’ve constantly offered new sonic surprises with every album, and have established themselves alongside modern luminaries like Yo La Tengo and Superchunk when it comes to their ability to evolve while still retaining what made them so special in the first place. Of the newest record, New York Magazine lauded, “The New Pornographers are a massive unit bursting with unique and intersecting talents…the band’s ninth album serves another helping of their signature dish.”<br/>The band’s new single “Ballad of the Last Payphone” is out now with a new full-length album slated for release in 2026 – more details to come.<br/>Critical acclaim for The New Pornographers:<br/>“Over the course of their 20-plus-year career, the New Pornographers have often specialized in catchy ambiguity. If leader Carl Newman was just a machine cranking out power-pop tunes, it would get boring. But there’s also a lot of mixed emotions going on under the surface of their studiously nuanced pop-rock formalism—like if Cheap Trick was as quick-witted as Steely Dan, or the Romantics were as thoughtful as R.E.M.” – Rolling Stone<br/>“Pure, blissfully irresistible power pop” – NPR Music<br/>“[The New Pornographers] make catchy, sophisticated alternate-universe hits.” – Stereogum]]></description>

With an unparalleled ability to command an audience with vibrant stage presence far beyond their years and toe-tapping anthems that beg to be sung along to, it’s clear that this is just the beginning for The Jack Wharff Band.

      <description><![CDATA[West King Street<br/><br/>Friday, February 27 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Born in Alabama and baptized in the dive bars of the southeast, Paul McDonald first made noise with the Grand Magnolias, a roots-rock outfit, before catching fire in the public eye during American Idol’s 2011 run.<br/>When the bright lights blurred and the cameras turned, the man behind the voice slipped into the shadows where he did what real artists do: He lived, he lost, and he wrote. Retreating to Nashville, that holy city of reinvention, Paul stitched himself back together with worn boots, hard songs, and a new band called the Mourning Doves.<br/>Now, in 2025, the giant has stirred with the release of “So Long to the Dark Side” – a gospel-tinged reckoning wrapped in cosmic Americana and lit with songs that sound like they were scribbled on the edge of a breakdown and sung back from the brink. Raised on Petty, Parsons, and pain, Paul McDonald is not chasing trends, he’s conjuring something older and truer. His live performances are equal parts revival and rock séance.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | YouTube]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[briZB<br/><br/>Saturday, February 28 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>The story of Nep begins in Daytona, Florida, a place of endless motorcycle rallies, sticky summers, and the kind of small-town culture she always knew she’d leave behind. Growing up surrounded by Bike Week and Biketoberfest, she felt both shaped and alienated by the noise of her hometown. “Beaches are fucked, Daytona sucks,” she sings on Biketoberfest, mocking and mourning the place that raised her.<br/>It’s that push and pull, the desire to escape and the need to memorialize, that fuels her debut album, Noelle. Written during her senior year at the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music, Nep crafted the record with her best friend and collaborator Jake Sonderman. Between classes, late-night studio sessions, and college parties that often bled into the lyrics themselves, the pair built an album that feels both diaristic and cinematic: raw experience refracted through sharp, infectious indie-pop.<br/>Each track on Noelle pulls from a different corner of Nep’s lived experience and explores a different sonic palette. All Around Beauty captures the heartbreak of running into an ex at a college party, blue tongues, Jell-O shots, tears in the bathroom. The title track, Noelle, sets aching strings against lyrics of rage and betrayal: “I was a kid / You were a guy / It’s not fair / I was a girl.” Black Car begins as a delicate piano ballad before erupting into a punk track with a heavy metal guitar solo, memorializing a summer defined by grief and family rituals. Scar leans into a bluegrass inspired folk arrangement that detonates into a harsh rock ending, tracing the way friendships can wound and mark us permanently. By the album’s end, July opens into a big band sound with horns dominating the track & points toward renewal: “I think I might love life again.” The final track, Florida Girl, closes the record with an anthem of self realization, a defiant chant that reclaims her roots while refusing to be defined by them.<br/>Nep has been building an audience for years, long before any records were even finished. Short clips and demos posted to TikTok racked up over 5 million likes, drawing fans to her mix of sardonic humor, brutal honesty, and a quirky charm that makes even her darkest songs feel oddly uplifting. She quickly translated that online energy to the stage, selling out early headline shows in Los Angeles, New York City, and Chicago, and touring alongside Ricky Montgomery, mxmtoon, and Grent Perez.<br/>With the release of Noelle, Nep is not just putting out an album; she’s leaving Florida behind. After years of translating Daytona’s beaches, bike rallies, and heartbreak into song, she’s moving to Los Angeles, a new chapter, a new landscape.<br/>Even so, traces of home are everywhere in her songs: in the defiance of Florida Girl (“You can never break a Florida girl”), in the humor and heartbreak of I Will Always Love You, Alright, and in the unflinching intimacy of The Soundtrack.<br/>Noelle is both an origin story and an emancipation. It documents the mess of youth and the catharsis of finally walking away. In Nep’s world, scars become anthems, heartbreak becomes punchlines, and growing up in Daytona becomes the stuff of unforgettable songs.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | YouTube | TikTok | Soundcloud | Spotify]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Six Foot Blonde<br/><br/>Friday, March 06 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>For The Nude Party, nearly a decade has flown by in the blink of an eye. In that time, the New York-based band has released a pair of well-received albums, an EP, and played countless shows. Prior to the pandemic, the band was really starting to hit its stride. They had a system in place and were spreading their brand of melodic rock to the masses. In fact, they could count Jack White, Arctic Monkeys, and Orville Peck as vocal supporters, which led to support slots for each. Soon, incredible live appearances at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, Newport Folk Festival, and Shaky Knees became the norm.<br/>Over the course of the last two years, The Nude Party decided to produce their new album, Rides On, themselves. With the help of Matthew Horner, The Nude Party had as much fun creating as they ever had at any other point in their career. Their new album includes 14 songs that dabble in electro-pop and stripped-down country. The Nude Party coalesced and embraced the spirit of collaboration. They’re excited to begin the next chapter of their career.<br/>At a time when it would have been easy to pack it in, the band continues to persevere.<br/>Website | Instagram | Facebook | YouTube | TikTok | Spotify]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[andmoreagain presents<br/><br/>Saturday, March 07 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>Dirtwire stands poised between ancient Mother Earth and modern technology, a blend of ethnomusicology and the psychedelic trance state, gut-bucket delta blues and what the band variously dubs “back-porch space cowboy blues, swamptronica, and electro-twang.” It’s a sound informed by Dirtwire’s travels and performances around the globe, where East meets West and North joins South. From the favelas in Brazil, Femi Kuti’s Shrine in Lagos, Tokyo’s bluegrass clubs, Ayahuasca ceremonies in Central America, Gamelan performances in Bali, desert festivals in the Australian Outback, and the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan’s modernized new capital Astana, the band spreads its message by building bridges across musical cultures in their own unique way.<br/>Dirtwire plays an array of instruments both ancient and modern, including West African kamale ngonis, jaw harps, space fiddles, whamola basses, Rickenbacher electric 12 string guitars, bowed Banjos and mouth harps from around the globe, all interwoven into modern laptop beat creation. Hailing from the underground west coast electronic bass music scene Dirtwire finds itself at the forefront of experimental electronic music production mixing in their wide array of world instruments with sampled beats and 808’s. Dirtwire’s live shows are a communal psychedelic journey, ranging from down home boot stomping get downs, to bass and blues electronic mashups, to ethereal cinematic beat driven soundscapes. Woven into each is the exploration of where live instruments meet computer production, and where tradition meets experimentation.<br/>Website | Spotify | Instagram | Bandcamp | YouTube | Facebook]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Salami Rose Joe Louis<br/><br/>Wednesday, March 11 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>Puma Blue is the alias of artist, producer & songwriter, Jacob Allen. Originally from South-London, currently based in Atlanta; Puma Blue first gained wider attention with his EPs Swum Baby (2017) & Blood Loss (2018). His debut album In Praise Of Shadows was released in 2021, followed by concert-film ‘A Late Night Special’. Noted for a blend of sensuality, intimate fragility & haunting, nocturnal ambience, Puma Blue’s live shows feature a band of close friends, blending jazz-influenced improvisation with a vocal energy often likened to Jeff Buckley. His second album Holy Waters, a darker, band-focused meditation on the acceptance of death, was released in 2023 & hailed a triumph. In 2025 it was followed by surprise album, antichamber, announced mere hours before release, an ambient, stripped-back body of work featuring obscure, minimalist arrangements & field recordings. In October 2025, Puma Blue announced that new music was once again imminent, sharing fragments of new single ‘Desire’ – set for release on 22nd October 2025.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | Soundcloud]]></description>

With rhythms that pulse like the sea, and vocal harmonies that announce the sunrise – their music balances serene lulls with bursts of righteous clamor, capturing both the tranquility and wildness of the coast. Each song is a journey, where moments of quiet beauty give way to sonic storms. Their sound is a reminder that life, like the ocean, is ever changing – a mix of peace and chaos, flowing together in perfect harmony.<br/>Website | Facebook | TikTok | YouTube | Instagram]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[andmoreagain presents<br/><br/>Saturday, March 14 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Everything about TWEN is hands-on. Ian produces, engineers, and mixes their albums. Jane designs every visual element, from videos, to posters, to merch. They’ve screen-printed their own shirts, booked their own tours, edited their own films, and built their tour van into a full-time mobile home. Their 2022 LP One Stop Shop wasn’t just a title, it was the truth. Even now, as their reach has expanded to a sold-out Red Rocks Amphitheatre show, opening arena tours, and having played 500+ shows across North America and Europe, they’ve kept full control. It’s proof you can exist outside the system and still make something that is current and alive.<br/>“TWEN, named after a post-war German magazine; a slang term for people in their twenties, has a sound that’s at once modern and nostalgic. Per the band, it’s ‘1965, 1995 and 2025 all at the same time.'” – Jax Today<br/>Written across highways & coastlines, their latest LP ‘Fate Euphoric’ isn’t nostalgic, though it nods to Britpop, psych, and new wave. It sounds more like the past filtered through the noise of right now. If ‘One Stop Shop’pointed out the problems of the 2020s from a first person perspective, ‘Fate Euphoric’ takes a bird’s-eye view, seeking comfort in the cosmic wheel that will always keep spinning. TWEN are a band in flux, and that’s the point. The van is still home, but the studio is wherever the signal feels right. The fate might be uncertain, but for now, it’s euphoric.<br/>Fate Euphoric is available on election day, November 4, 2025 via the band’s own label Twenterprises.<br/>Website | Instagram | Facebook | Youtube | Spotify | Bandcamp | TikTok]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[h.pruz<br/><br/>Monday, March 16 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>And Your Song is Like a Circle, the second album from New York-based artist Skullcrusher, a.k.a. Helen Ballentine, winds its way into an everchanging, unstable core. Recorded piecemeal over a period of years following the release of her celebrated 2022 debut, Quiet the Room, And Your Song is Like a Circle does not capture experience – it gestures toward the imprint of an experience that is uncapturable. Swaying between vaporous folk and crystalline electronics, landing somewhere in the snowfields shared by Grouper and Julia Holter, Circle probes the ways that grief turns itself inside out. Loss itself becomes as real and substantial as what’s been lost.<br/>Ballentine began writing Circle after leaving Los Angeles, a city she’d called home for nearly a decade. She ended up returning upstate to New York’s Hudson Valley, where she was born and raised. Several years of intense isolation followed, and Ballentine immersed herself in films, books, and art that reflected the rupture of relocating cross-country and its dissociative aftershocks.<br/>Throughout the record, the line between human and machine blurs. On “Maelstrom,” voices crash between echoing drumbeats like water through a cavern. The vocal filigrees on “Exhale” fan out into a haze of synthesizers and strings. “Dragon” lets piano echo over tight, gritted percussion.<br/>If Skullcrusher’s first album rendered the detailed intimacies of domestic space, Circle finds itself vaporized across the landscape: swirling, drifting, searching. It skirts an event horizon in long, slow strokes. These are songs that vibrate with the fervency of an attempt to capture a moment, to draw a circle around it. “I like thinking about my work as a collection,” Ballentine says. “Eventually it might form a circle. Each time I make something, I’m putting another line around the body of work. It feels like I’ll be trying to trace it for my whole life.”<br/>Website | Facebook | TikTok | Instagram]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Friday, April 24 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>In a world where authenticity is often sacrificed, Krooked Kings stand as a beacon of unabashed vulnerability and raw emotion. Their indie rock sound is a candid reflection of their influences, drawing from the ornate and biting guitar arrangements of The Strokes, the introspective depth of Bon Iver, and the easygoing charm of Peach Pit. But while these inspirations shape their musical foundation, it’s the band’s own narrative that sets them apart.<br/>At the heart of Krooked Kings’ music is a brutally honest portrayal of the twenty-something experience in America—capturing the restlessness, dreams, and disillusionments of a generation navigating the complexities of modern life. Their lyrics resonate with the tumultuous yet exhilarating journey of coming of age, making each song a poignant and relatable exploration of life’s ups and downs.<br/>Krooked Kings burst onto the scene with a fervor that quickly captivated audiences across Europe and North America, culminating in a debut tour that left an indelible mark on their fans. Their ability to connect on a profound level is evident not just in their packed shows but also in their impressive digital footprint. With over 70 million streams on their albums, their music has reverberated across the globe, cementing their status as a rising force in indie rock.<br/>Their presence isn’t just isolated to the realm of underground fans and loyal listeners, having gained critical acclaim and placements on some of Spotify’s most sought after playlists in the genre including “Today’s Indie Rock”, “Feel Good Indie Rock”, “Marrow”, and many more.<br/>With their fearless approach to songwriting and an ever-expanding fanbase, they’re poised to redefine the boundaries of indie rock and make their mark on the world stage.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | TikTok]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Wednesday, April 29 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Arts Fishing Club is more than just a band; they are storytellers, explorers of the human condition, and purveyors of living life boldly. An ethos demonstrated by frontman Christopher Kessenich’s first 4.5 month tour in which he walked 1600 miles along the east coast from Maine to Atlanta to Nashville, played 60 shows, and slept in strangers’ living room floors. The boldness that compelled such an adventure is felt in AFC’s electrifying live shows where the band weaves the raw energy of rock and the introspective lyrical honesty of folk to create a sound that is timeless and refreshingly original. Whether performing in sold out small clubs or on festival stages (Bonnaroo, Summerfest, Treefort, Mile of Music), their engaging stage presence and ability to connect with fans makes their live performances a cornerstone of their success. With a growing fanbase, commitment to pushing their creative boundaries, and an infectiously entertaining live show, Arts Fishing Club is poised to make a lasting impact on the indie music landscape.<br/>Website | Instagram | Facebook | Spotify | YouTube]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Sunday, May 17 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>With Improvement Movement<br/>Iron & Wine is the musical project of singer-songwriter Sam Beam. Born and raised in South Carolina, Beam is a former film professor who got his start making home recordings before landing on Sub Pop Records. Iron & Wine’s 2002 debut, The Creek Drank the Cradle garnered both critical and popular acclaim, vaulting Beam into the spotlight of the burgeoning indie-folk/Americana scene as one of its new and leading voices.<br/>For over 20 years, Iron & Wine has captured the emotion and imagination of listeners with distinctly cinematic songs. His recorded output includes seven full-length studio records, collaborations with Calexico, Ben Bridwell (Band of Horses), and Jesca Hoop, countless EP’s, singles and compilation/soundtrack appearances, a live concert documentary, and five GRAMMY nominations.<br/>Iron & Wine’s latest record, Light Verse was released in April 2024 with Paste Magazine noting “… Beam returns with an expanded sonic palette while also rekindling the bright spark that made 2007’s The Shepherd’s Dog so magical.”<br/>Website | Instagram | Facebook | YouTube | Spotify]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Tuesday, May 05 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>Over the past twenty plus years, Cass McCombs has journeyed a singular path as an uncompromising song-carver, guitarist and singer.<br/>Along with the finest squadron of collaborators and bandmates, his music travels gracefully over seemingly contradictory terrain, from infectious guitar riffage to intensely personal lyricism.<br/>In August 2025, Cass released his newest album “Interior Live Oak” to rave reviews including 5 stars from the Guardian, an 8.1 from Pitchfork who said “16 songs and not a throwaway among them…,” a 9/10 from Uncut Magazine, and a rave from Mojo magazine who said “…this is the kind of record it’s impossible to be casual about.”<br/>Interior Live Oak is his most personal album to date, and, more than any previous record, shows his vast range as a lyricist and musician. It draws from everything Cass has created over two decades of experimentation to cut through with a direct and clarifying light.<br/>Cass McCombs will embark on his “Interior Live Oak Live” tour over 2026. He lives in New York City.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | Soundcloud | Spotify]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Seated Show<br/><br/>Friday, March 20 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>This is a seated show.<br/>Minneapolis songwriter Mason Jennings shares his new video for the single, “Only Lovers Welcome” from his brand new album, Underneath The Roses out now via Loosegroove Records. Underneath The Roses is available on limited-edition colored vinyl and is available here. Watch and share the video for “Only Lovers Welcome” here.<br/>Jennings writes that the songs from Underneath The Roses were, “Written in an unprecedented burst,” following the birth of his son, Western, in March 2022. Jennings explains, “I hadn’t written any songs in about a year. I had been dealing with the psychological after effects of the pandemic as well as the loss of my dad. So, when Western was born I didn’t expect to be writing much. But immediately he was responding to music in a very intense way. For this album, between May and November 2022, I wrote 48 songs! They certainly uplifted me and connected me with the creative spirit, and spirit in general, again. They cover all kinds of ground but, when I listen back, I think the central theme is overcoming fear with love.”<br/>Jennings also released a video for, “No Ordinary Friend,” which he explains, “Depicts two of the most important decisions a person can make. One, whether or not they believe in a loving higher power and two, who they decide to choose as a life long romantic partner. This song is referring to both of those and the choices I’ve made.”<br/>“Stone Gossard and Regan Hagar from Loosegroove Records helped me edit the 48 down to 11. I then enlisted the help of my Painted Shield bandmates to record the songs.”<br/>Jennings and Gossard are ongoing collaborators in the band Painted Shield, who released their 2021 debut album on Loosegroove, the influential indie label that Gossard founded back in 1994 issued records from acts such as Critters Buggin, Malfunkshun, Weapon of Choice and Devilhead, and was the launching point for Queens of the Stone Age’s debut album in 1998.<br/>Jenning’s previous album ‘Real Heart’ came out in January 2022 and received Triple/Non-comm radio across KCMP Minneapolis, WFPK Louisville, WPYA Birmingham, KRCL Salt Lake City, WMMM Madison, WQKL Ann Arbor, KCSN LA, KRVB Boise, WCLZ Portland, WDSE Duluth, WRLT Nashville, WXPN Philly, WXRV Boston, & WZEW Mobile.<br/>Press highlights include: American Songwriter, Relix, No Depression, Grateful Web, Take Effect 9/10 review, & Jam Bands<br/>Jennings adds “I called it Underneath The Roses because I feel like these songs are musical roses and when I look below them there are many thorns and so much dirt and soil. All of it was needed for them to come into existence and bloom. It’s been a long hard road of self-discovery and discernment for me the last few years and the roses wouldn’t be here without what lies underneath. Hope you enjoy the music!”<br/>Website | Spotify | Facebook | Instagram]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Dead Butterflies, Stella<br/><br/>Monday, April 06 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Camping in Alaska is a post-emo band based in Huntsville, AL. Austin Davis and Jacob Stewart started writing music together at age 15, drawing from influences of childhood-favorite bands such as Jawbreaker, Modest Mouse, and Knapsack. They started their careers in Austin’s mom’s garage and soon began playing DIY shows all around North Alabama with the addition of Ben Cape and Jacob Hill. Their breakout album about being in high school and hanging out in parking lots, please be nice, was recorded in 2013 and quickly took underground internet forums by storm after the popular YouTube channel jommeez uploaded the album, their most popular song, “c u in da ballpit,” holding 1.9 million views to date. After Ben left the band, BATHE was recorded in 2014 and picked up by Broken World Media for a cassette release in 2015.<br/>The band took a hiatus for a couple of years after recording WELCOME HOME SON in 2016, a darker, more serious album about addiction and loss. With the addition of Dani Fandre, the band made a strong comeback in 2022, releasing an EP of acoustic demos recorded through 2017 and 2018 called Lost & Found and selling out both of their come-back shows.<br/>In September 2023 they released Hollow Eyes, a precursor to their next full length, drawing influence from Jawbox and The Weakerthans and grappling with more mature subject matter pertaining to addiction, homelessness and finding a way out. After the success of an almost all-sold-out Midwest and East Coast please be nice Ten Year Anniversary tour, Camping in Alaska plans to go back to the studio to record their long-awaited full length Eggbeater Jesus and hit the road again on the West Coast in 2024.<br/>Instagram | Spotify | YouTube | Bandcamp]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Tuesday, June 09 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>Is The New Sound a tonic for these times? Let’s ask Geordie Greep.<br/>“Music can be so much more than learning to play the same as everybody else. It can be anything you want. With recording The New Sound, it was the first time I have had no one to answer to. Being in a band (black midi), we often have this ‘we can do everything’ feeling, but you are also kind of limited in that approach, and sometimes it’s good to do something else, to let go of things.” Geordie’s debut solo album boasts a brand of high quality, all-embracing alternative pop fun not heard in a very long time, walking the line between the ridiculous and brilliant with a teflon-coated aplomb.<br/>How the record came about is a thing to marvel at. Over thirty session musicians were involved in its making, on two continents. Greep says, “Half of the tracks were done in Brazil, with local musicians pulled together at the last minute. They’d never heard anything I’d done before, they were just interested in the demos I’d made. The tracking was all done in one, maybe two days.” The spirit of Greep’s increasingly febrile and furtive soliloquies simultaneously calls to mind both Frank Zappa and Frank Sinatra, with a healthy dash of Scott Walker sprinkled throughout. The instrumental title track is a jazz-funk workout that could double as a soundtrack for a TV series or the intro music for a Broadway musical. Brass, wah-wah pedal and bass stabs, choruses and polyrhythms, all fizz and tumble around the place creating a sense of excitement and expectation. Tracks often oscillate from whispers to shouts, and start and end on a bang.<br/>The stories themselves act as a shopping list of the Active Male Imagination. A series of vignettes, where Geordie Greep plays the role of emcee and conductor. The characters we hear from are engaged in wild fantasies and situations in which they inevitably falter. “The main theme of the record is desperation; someone who is kidding themselves that they have everything under control, but they don’t.” Here Greep gives color to a set of imaginings which include cannibalism, being boiled alive, and a woman giving birth to a goat. Street life is all around The New Sound: the listener is thrown into a world of cafes, bars, rented rooms, cabarets and strange museums. Here we see our heroes carry out a series of naughty assignments, military cosplay or socio-economic triumphs. The lines between parody and sermon are often blurred. The urbane romantic fantasy of single ‘Holy Holy’ tells the story of an imaginary liaison in a nightclub, soundtracked by ’noughties indie chords and bravura Latin big band arrangements – including a three-piano attack. What next? “My plan is to ‘do a Keith Jarrett thing’, have a different group of session musicians in a different place and lean into the fact that we’re not going to get it the same.”<br/>How can anything ever be ‘the same’ with Greep at the helm?<br/>Website | Instagram]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Tuesday, May 05 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Gelli Haha exists somewhere between Studio 54 and Area 51, where dancefloors become playgrounds and cheeky aesthetics ignite imagination. A shapeshifter, a sonic acrobat, a performer with one foot in the cosmos and the other in a slapstick routine, Gelli Haha is a space for pure creative chaos.<br/>For her opening trick, Gelli Haha presents Switcheroo, the debut album via Innovative Leisure, to be released in June 2025. With a shared taste for off-kilter pop and vintage gear, producer Sean Guerin (of De Lux) joined Gelli in turning freshly-formed demos into a high-voltage experiment, abandoning meticulous structure for something freer and more electrifying. Every song on Switcheroo makes use of a myriad of recording toys; wacky analog effects, such as the Eventide Harmonizer, MXR Pitch Transposer, and various Electrix units, fashion an intentionally flawed and strictly silly texture throughout the album.<br/>Gelli Haha’s music thrives on duality: playful but profound, tongue-in-cheek but sincere. “Bounce House” is the child-like innocence; “Spit” is the S-words-only underground-club grit. “Piss Artist” revels in tequila-fueled storytelling about an infamous party moment (involving a jar — don’t ask, just dance), while “Normalize” feels like you’re stuck in Play-Doh.<br/>It’s a practice in play – recording vocals mid-jump, translating drum fills into mouth sounds, granting your best friend’s wish for a song about them. A bear attack crashes through the happy-go-lucky “Dynamite”, “Funny Music” ends with a sudden “BONK!”— because why not?<br/>The emotional rainbow stretches beyond the positive — Gelli pouts and wails on “Tiramisu”, demanding to know and feel everything, while “Pluto is not a planet it’s a restaurant” closes the album in a darker, heart-throbbing track with the repeated cry: “I’m afraid.”<br/>Switcheroo is the soundtrack to the Gelliverse, a sensory adventure sphere created by Gelli. This live revue is an invitation into a world of dolphin balloons, flutes, mini trampolines, and a stage bathed in the project’s primary color, red – bold and full of mischief.<br/>Gelli Haha isn’t foolproof. It’s by design. Switcheroo is an exercise in letting go, an inside joke turned theatrical spectacle. Participation is encouraged. Surrender is required.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Pollen<br/><br/>Thursday, April 02 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Rigometrics is making serious waves in the Northeast music scene with a dynamic, high-energy sound that blends the soul of classic rock with the grit of funk and blues, the hooks of indie, and the urgency of modern alternative. Their music fuses Josef Berger’s searing guitar work, Derek Haney’s hard-hitting, groove-driven drums, and Keenan Hendricks’ soaring vocals and swaggering piano, which doubles as the bass in their live setup, creating a genre-blurring style that feels both timeless and fresh. The result is a live experience and growing catalog that consistently draws in diverse audiences and fuels an ever-expanding, loyal fan base.<br/>Since forming in 2021, the three-piece has toured the East Coast and South ten times, sold out 300-cap venues, headlined major shows in Maine, and played over 350 gigs, entirely independently. Their catalog includes 2025’s Live in Maine II and single Couldn’t Tell Ya, 2024’s EP Elodie, live album Live in Maine, and singles Endless Road, All My Friends (Live for the Weekend), and No Smoke; 2023’s EP No Time to Waste and single Share the Fortune; and their 2022 debut album Rig N’ Roll. These projects are being shared through constant energetic live performances and an undeniable stage presence via a renovated school bus that the Rigometrics calls home when on the road.<br/>To bring these releases to life, Rigometrics collaborated with top-tier producers Jon Wyman, Matt Perry, and Anthony Gatti, as well as Grammy winners Dave Gutter, Adam Ayan, and ‘Bassy’ Bob Brockmann. Together, they crafted music that elevates Rigometrics’ signature sound while staying deeply rooted in the spirit of rock ‘n’ roll.<br/>LinkTree | Instagram | Spotify | TikTok | YouTube]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Saturday, April 25 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>“It’s always been the case that everyone is going through something that you may not be aware of,” says the band’s Mac McCaughan. “This is currently more true than ever—but also the case that we are all going through some things together. In the face of that, what good is art and where is happiness found? (Spoiler alert: I don’t know.)”<br/>In seeking an answer, Songs in the Key of Yikes unleashes a sound that is triumphant and bright in the darkness, Majesty Shredding in overdrive. Lead single “Is It Making You Feel Something” sets the tone early with the band—McCaughan, Laura Ballance, Jim Wilbur, and Laura King—building an anthem out of the potential for joy, diving into slop-polluted waters (“now fakes are faking everything / that once made your poor heart sing”) and emerging with a pearl.<br/>“This song is about not second-guessing yourself in the very second-guessable process of writing words and music,” McCaughan explains. “It’s about the legitimate question of ‘who needs this and what is it good for?’ but also about not setting such a high bar for making art that you never get started. ‘Is it making you feel something?’ Ok, that’s a place to start.”<br/>Songs in the Key of Yikes is a signature Superchunk album: visceral and timeless and catchy as hell—a cathartic balm for these oppressive times that will feel even better once we’ve figured our collective shit out.<br/>Website | Facebook]]></description>
