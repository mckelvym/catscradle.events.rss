      <description><![CDATA[Wild Oak, Pollen<br/><br/>Thursday, January 22 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>The John Wood Band is a soulful, six-piece indie rock band out of Wilmington, NC. The band formed at UNCW, led by lead singer and songwriter John Wood, who is known for songs such as Coffee On The Beach and Dry Eyes. With six pieces in the band, you can always expect a dynamic and electric set. They have played alongside acts such as Congress The Band, Winyah, Harvey Street, Innlet, The Vegabonds, Wim Tapley, and Easy Honey. Catch The John Wood Band on tour all year long!<br/>Instagram | Spotify<br/>Wild Oak is an indie rock band out of Chapel Hill, NC. Battling through noise complaints and cop visits, the band played their first gig in February of 2025. With a sound somewhere between the Backseat Lovers and Ax and the Hatchetmen, Wild Oak hits the stage each night, sharing one thing with the audience: love for music.<br/>Pollen is an indie/alt-rock band based in Chapel Hill, NC. Formed when a casual invite to play, evolved into the first practice. The name Pollen comes from hours spent practicing outside, each time ending with the band covered in yellow dust. Drawing inspiration from staple bands like The Red Hot Chili Peppers and blending in the fresh, melodic edge of modern indie rock, Pollen is slowly cementing themselves in the vibrant Chapel Hill live music scene. They aim to bring the energy and fun of a cramped house show to every venue they play.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Seated Show<br/><br/>Friday, March 20 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>This is a seated show.<br/>Minneapolis songwriter Mason Jennings shares his new video for the single, “Only Lovers Welcome” from his brand new album, Underneath The Roses out now via Loosegroove Records. Underneath The Roses is available on limited-edition colored vinyl and is available here. Watch and share the video for “Only Lovers Welcome” here.<br/>Jennings writes that the songs from Underneath The Roses were, “Written in an unprecedented burst,” following the birth of his son, Western, in March 2022. Jennings explains, “I hadn’t written any songs in about a year. I had been dealing with the psychological after effects of the pandemic as well as the loss of my dad. So, when Western was born I didn’t expect to be writing much. But immediately he was responding to music in a very intense way. For this album, between May and November 2022, I wrote 48 songs! They certainly uplifted me and connected me with the creative spirit, and spirit in general, again. They cover all kinds of ground but, when I listen back, I think the central theme is overcoming fear with love.”<br/>Jennings also released a video for, “No Ordinary Friend,” which he explains, “Depicts two of the most important decisions a person can make. One, whether or not they believe in a loving higher power and two, who they decide to choose as a life long romantic partner. This song is referring to both of those and the choices I’ve made.”<br/>“Stone Gossard and Regan Hagar from Loosegroove Records helped me edit the 48 down to 11. I then enlisted the help of my Painted Shield bandmates to record the songs.”<br/>Jennings and Gossard are ongoing collaborators in the band Painted Shield, who released their 2021 debut album on Loosegroove, the influential indie label that Gossard founded back in 1994 issued records from acts such as Critters Buggin, Malfunkshun, Weapon of Choice and Devilhead, and was the launching point for Queens of the Stone Age’s debut album in 1998.<br/>Jenning’s previous album ‘Real Heart’ came out in January 2022 and received Triple/Non-comm radio across KCMP Minneapolis, WFPK Louisville, WPYA Birmingham, KRCL Salt Lake City, WMMM Madison, WQKL Ann Arbor, KCSN LA, KRVB Boise, WCLZ Portland, WDSE Duluth, WRLT Nashville, WXPN Philly, WXRV Boston, & WZEW Mobile.<br/>Press highlights include: American Songwriter, Relix, No Depression, Grateful Web, Take Effect 9/10 review, & Jam Bands<br/>Jennings adds “I called it Underneath The Roses because I feel like these songs are musical roses and when I look below them there are many thorns and so much dirt and soil. All of it was needed for them to come into existence and bloom. It’s been a long hard road of self-discovery and discernment for me the last few years and the roses wouldn’t be here without what lies underneath. Hope you enjoy the music!”<br/>Website | Spotify | Facebook | Instagram]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Tuesday, May 05 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>Over the past twenty plus years, Cass McCombs has journeyed a singular path as an uncompromising song-carver, guitarist and singer.<br/>Along with the finest squadron of collaborators and bandmates, his music travels gracefully over seemingly contradictory terrain, from infectious guitar riffage to intensely personal lyricism.<br/>In August 2025, Cass released his newest album “Interior Live Oak” to rave reviews including 5 stars from the Guardian, an 8.1 from Pitchfork who said “16 songs and not a throwaway among them…,” a 9/10 from Uncut Magazine, and a rave from Mojo magazine who said “…this is the kind of record it’s impossible to be casual about.”<br/>Interior Live Oak is his most personal album to date, and, more than any previous record, shows his vast range as a lyricist and musician. It draws from everything Cass has created over two decades of experimentation to cut through with a direct and clarifying light.<br/>Cass McCombs will embark on his “Interior Live Oak Live” tour over 2026. He lives in New York City.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | Soundcloud | Spotify]]></description>

A shapeshifter, a sonic acrobat, a performer with one foot in the cosmos and the other in a slapstick routine, Gelli Haha is a space for pure creative chaos.<br/>For her opening trick, Gelli Haha presents Switcheroo, the debut album via Innovative Leisure, to be released in June 2025. With a shared taste for off-kilter pop and vintage gear, producer Sean Guerin (of De Lux) joined Gelli in turning freshly-formed demos into a high-voltage experiment, abandoning meticulous structure for something freer and more electrifying. Every song on Switcheroo makes use of a myriad of recording toys; wacky analog effects, such as the Eventide Harmonizer, MXR Pitch Transposer, and various Electrix units, fashion an intentionally flawed and strictly silly texture throughout the album.<br/>Gelli Haha’s music thrives on duality: playful but profound, tongue-in-cheek but sincere. “Bounce House” is the child-like innocence; “Spit” is the S-words-only underground-club grit. “Piss Artist” revels in tequila-fueled storytelling about an infamous party moment (involving a jar — don’t ask, just dance), while “Normalize” feels like you’re stuck in Play-Doh.<br/>It’s a practice in play – recording vocals mid-jump, translating drum fills into mouth sounds, granting your best friend’s wish for a song about them. A bear attack crashes through the happy-go-lucky “Dynamite”, “Funny Music” ends with a sudden “BONK!”— because why not?<br/>The emotional rainbow stretches beyond the positive — Gelli pouts and wails on “Tiramisu”, demanding to know and feel everything, while “Pluto is not a planet it’s a restaurant” closes the album in a darker, heart-throbbing track with the repeated cry: “I’m afraid.”<br/>Switcheroo is the soundtrack to the Gelliverse, a sensory adventure sphere created by Gelli. This live revue is an invitation into a world of dolphin balloons, flutes, mini trampolines, and a stage bathed in the project’s primary color, red – bold and full of mischief.<br/>Gelli Haha isn’t foolproof. It’s by design. Switcheroo is an exercise in letting go, an inside joke turned theatrical spectacle. Participation is encouraged. Surrender is required.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Rhineland<br/><br/>Saturday, February 21 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Since 2016, Vacation Manor combine an artful blend of eloquent lyricism, alternative experimentation, indie rock energy, and unassuming pop appeal. The duo—Nathan Towles [guitar, vocals] and Cole Young [drums]—have earned acclaim from American Songwriter, Atwood, and more. Now, they pull fans deeper into their embrace on their 2025 EP [Nettwerk].<br/>“We value people above all,” adds Nathan. “For us, our music is always better when we can involve our good friends in the process and experience something together. That in and of itself feels like a success for us.”<br/>This community grasped onto the music and never let go. Vacation Manor emerged with the Girl, Say EP highlighted by “Careless” and the breakout “A Toast and a Spirit.” The pair progressed over the course of Everything I Can’t Say Out Loud [2019] and Vacation Manor [2021]. Along the way, they toured alongside Briston Maroney and Night Traveler, in addition to performing at festivals such as Bright Shade Music & Arts Festival. The guys carefully assembled what would become the EP over two years. This time around, songs represented “different landmarks” in their shared and individual experiences. Recording out of a home studio in Virginia, Nathan and Cole self-produced the tracks, nodding to inspirations a la Oasis and The Sundays.<br/>In the end, Vacation Manor’s community will only continue to grow. “With anything we put out, we want to give people language to the things that they’re experiencing too,” Nathan leaves off. “It’s a way for us all to process life.”<br/>Website | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook]]></description>
