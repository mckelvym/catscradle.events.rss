      <description><![CDATA[Wild Oak, Pollen<br/><br/>Thursday, January 22 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>The John Wood Band is a soulful, six-piece indie rock band out of Wilmington, NC. The band formed at UNCW, led by lead singer and songwriter John Wood, who is known for songs such as Coffee On The Beach and Dry Eyes. With six pieces in the band, you can always expect a dynamic and electric set. They have played alongside acts such as Congress The Band, Winyah, Harvey Street, Innlet, The Vegabonds, Wim Tapley, and Easy Honey. Catch The John Wood Band on tour all year long!<br/>Instagram | Spotify<br/>Wild Oak is an indie rock band out of Chapel Hill, NC. Battling through noise complaints and cop visits, the band played their first gig in February of 2025. With a sound somewhere between the Backseat Lovers and Ax and the Hatchetmen, Wild Oak hits the stage each night, sharing one thing with the audience: love for music.<br/>Pollen is an indie/alt-rock band based in Chapel Hill, NC. Formed when a casual invite to play, evolved into the first practice. The name Pollen comes from hours spent practicing outside, each time ending with the band covered in yellow dust. Drawing inspiration from staple bands like The Red Hot Chili Peppers and blending in the fresh, melodic edge of modern indie rock, Pollen is slowly cementing themselves in the vibrant Chapel Hill live music scene. They aim to bring the energy and fun of a cramped house show to every venue they play.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Rhineland<br/><br/>Saturday, February 21 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Since 2016, Vacation Manor combine an artful blend of eloquent lyricism, alternative experimentation, indie rock energy, and unassuming pop appeal. The duo—Nathan Towles [guitar, vocals] and Cole Young [drums]—have earned acclaim from American Songwriter, Atwood, and more. Now, they pull fans deeper into their embrace on their 2025 EP [Nettwerk].<br/>“We value people above all,” adds Nathan. “For us, our music is always better when we can involve our good friends in the process and experience something together. That in and of itself feels like a success for us.”<br/>This community grasped onto the music and never let go. Vacation Manor emerged with the Girl, Say EP highlighted by “Careless” and the breakout “A Toast and a Spirit.” The pair progressed over the course of Everything I Can’t Say Out Loud [2019] and Vacation Manor [2021]. Along the way, they toured alongside Briston Maroney and Night Traveler, in addition to performing at festivals such as Bright Shade Music & Arts Festival. The guys carefully assembled what would become the EP over two years. This time around, songs represented “different landmarks” in their shared and individual experiences. Recording out of a home studio in Virginia, Nathan and Cole self-produced the tracks, nodding to inspirations a la Oasis and The Sundays.<br/>In the end, Vacation Manor’s community will only continue to grow. “With anything we put out, we want to give people language to the things that they’re experiencing too,” Nathan leaves off. “It’s a way for us all to process life.”<br/>Website | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook]]></description>
