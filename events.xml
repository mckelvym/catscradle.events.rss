      <description><![CDATA[Tuesday, May 05 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>Over the past twenty plus years, Cass McCombs has journeyed a singular path as an uncompromising song-carver, guitarist and singer.<br/>Along with the finest squadron of collaborators and bandmates, his music travels gracefully over seemingly contradictory terrain, from infectious guitar riffage to intensely personal lyricism.<br/>In August 2025, Cass released his newest album “Interior Live Oak” to rave reviews including 5 stars from the Guardian, an 8.1 from Pitchfork who said “16 songs and not a throwaway among them…,” a 9/10 from Uncut Magazine, and a rave from Mojo magazine who said “…this is the kind of record it’s impossible to be casual about.”<br/>Interior Live Oak is his most personal album to date, and, more than any previous record, shows his vast range as a lyricist and musician. It draws from everything Cass has created over two decades of experimentation to cut through with a direct and clarifying light.<br/>Cass McCombs will embark on his “Interior Live Oak Live” tour over 2026. He lives in New York City.<br/>Website | Facebook | Instagram | Soundcloud | Spotify]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Seated Show<br/><br/>Friday, March 20 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>This is a seated show.<br/>Minneapolis songwriter Mason Jennings shares his new video for the single, “Only Lovers Welcome” from his brand new album, Underneath The Roses out now via Loosegroove Records. Underneath The Roses is available on limited-edition colored vinyl and is available here. Watch and share the video for “Only Lovers Welcome” here.<br/>Jennings writes that the songs from Underneath The Roses were, “Written in an unprecedented burst,” following the birth of his son, Western, in March 2022. Jennings explains, “I hadn’t written any songs in about a year. I had been dealing with the psychological after effects of the pandemic as well as the loss of my dad. So, when Western was born I didn’t expect to be writing much. But immediately he was responding to music in a very intense way. For this album, between May and November 2022, I wrote 48 songs! They certainly uplifted me and connected me with the creative spirit, and spirit in general, again. They cover all kinds of ground but, when I listen back, I think the central theme is overcoming fear with love.”<br/>Jennings also released a video for, “No Ordinary Friend,” which he explains, “Depicts two of the most important decisions a person can make. One, whether or not they believe in a loving higher power and two, who they decide to choose as a life long romantic partner. This song is referring to both of those and the choices I’ve made.”<br/>“Stone Gossard and Regan Hagar from Loosegroove Records helped me edit the 48 down to 11. I then enlisted the help of my Painted Shield bandmates to record the songs.”<br/>Jennings and Gossard are ongoing collaborators in the band Painted Shield, who released their 2021 debut album on Loosegroove, the influential indie label that Gossard founded back in 1994 issued records from acts such as Critters Buggin, Malfunkshun, Weapon of Choice and Devilhead, and was the launching point for Queens of the Stone Age’s debut album in 1998.<br/>Jenning’s previous album ‘Real Heart’ came out in January 2022 and received Triple/Non-comm radio across KCMP Minneapolis, WFPK Louisville, WPYA Birmingham, KRCL Salt Lake City, WMMM Madison, WQKL Ann Arbor, KCSN LA, KRVB Boise, WCLZ Portland, WDSE Duluth, WRLT Nashville, WXPN Philly, WXRV Boston, & WZEW Mobile.<br/>Press highlights include: American Songwriter, Relix, No Depression, Grateful Web, Take Effect 9/10 review, & Jam Bands<br/>Jennings adds “I called it Underneath The Roses because I feel like these songs are musical roses and when I look below them there are many thorns and so much dirt and soil. All of it was needed for them to come into existence and bloom. It’s been a long hard road of self-discovery and discernment for me the last few years and the roses wouldn’t be here without what lies underneath. Hope you enjoy the music!”<br/>Website | Spotify | Facebook | Instagram]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Dead Butterflies, Stella<br/><br/>Monday, April 06 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Camping in Alaska is a post-emo band based in Huntsville, AL. Austin Davis and Jacob Stewart started writing music together at age 15, drawing from influences of childhood-favorite bands such as Jawbreaker, Modest Mouse, and Knapsack. They started their careers in Austin’s mom’s garage and soon began playing DIY shows all around North Alabama with the addition of Ben Cape and Jacob Hill. Their breakout album about being in high school and hanging out in parking lots, please be nice, was recorded in 2013 and quickly took underground internet forums by storm after the popular YouTube channel jommeez uploaded the album, their most popular song, “c u in da ballpit,” holding 1.9 million views to date. After Ben left the band, BATHE was recorded in 2014 and picked up by Broken World Media for a cassette release in 2015.<br/>The band took a hiatus for a couple of years after recording WELCOME HOME SON in 2016, a darker, more serious album about addiction and loss. With the addition of Dani Fandre, the band made a strong comeback in 2022, releasing an EP of acoustic demos recorded through 2017 and 2018 called Lost & Found and selling out both of their come-back shows.<br/>In September 2023 they released Hollow Eyes, a precursor to their next full length, drawing influence from Jawbox and The Weakerthans and grappling with more mature subject matter pertaining to addiction, homelessness and finding a way out. After the success of an almost all-sold-out Midwest and East Coast please be nice Ten Year Anniversary tour, Camping in Alaska plans to go back to the studio to record their long-awaited full length Eggbeater Jesus and hit the road again on the West Coast in 2024.<br/>Instagram | Spotify | YouTube | Bandcamp]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Tuesday, June 09 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>Is The New Sound a tonic for these times? Let’s ask Geordie Greep.<br/>“Music can be so much more than learning to play the same as everybody else. It can be anything you want. With recording The New Sound, it was the first time I have had no one to answer to. Being in a band (black midi), we often have this ‘we can do everything’ feeling, but you are also kind of limited in that approach, and sometimes it’s good to do something else, to let go of things.” Geordie’s debut solo album boasts a brand of high quality, all-embracing alternative pop fun not heard in a very long time, walking the line between the ridiculous and brilliant with a teflon-coated aplomb.<br/>How the record came about is a thing to marvel at. Over thirty session musicians were involved in its making, on two continents. Greep says, “Half of the tracks were done in Brazil, with local musicians pulled together at the last minute. They’d never heard anything I’d done before, they were just interested in the demos I’d made. The tracking was all done in one, maybe two days.” The spirit of Greep’s increasingly febrile and furtive soliloquies simultaneously calls to mind both Frank Zappa and Frank Sinatra, with a healthy dash of Scott Walker sprinkled throughout. The instrumental title track is a jazz-funk workout that could double as a soundtrack for a TV series or the intro music for a Broadway musical. Brass, wah-wah pedal and bass stabs, choruses and polyrhythms, all fizz and tumble around the place creating a sense of excitement and expectation. Tracks often oscillate from whispers to shouts, and start and end on a bang.<br/>The stories themselves act as a shopping list of the Active Male Imagination. A series of vignettes, where Geordie Greep plays the role of emcee and conductor. The characters we hear from are engaged in wild fantasies and situations in which they inevitably falter. “The main theme of the record is desperation; someone who is kidding themselves that they have everything under control, but they don’t.” Here Greep gives color to a set of imaginings which include cannibalism, being boiled alive, and a woman giving birth to a goat. Street life is all around The New Sound: the listener is thrown into a world of cafes, bars, rented rooms, cabarets and strange museums. Here we see our heroes carry out a series of naughty assignments, military cosplay or socio-economic triumphs. The lines between parody and sermon are often blurred. The urbane romantic fantasy of single ‘Holy Holy’ tells the story of an imaginary liaison in a nightclub, soundtracked by ’noughties indie chords and bravura Latin big band arrangements – including a three-piano attack. What next? “My plan is to ‘do a Keith Jarrett thing’, have a different group of session musicians in a different place and lean into the fact that we’re not going to get it the same.”<br/>How can anything ever be ‘the same’ with Greep at the helm?<br/>Website | Instagram]]></description>

      <title>Gelli Haha – Where in the World is Gelli Haha Tour 2026 (Tuesday, May 05 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm)</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Tuesday, May 05 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Gelli Haha exists somewhere between Studio 54 and Area 51, where dancefloors become playgrounds and cheeky aesthetics ignite imagination. A shapeshifter, a sonic acrobat, a performer with one foot in the cosmos and the other in a slapstick routine, Gelli Haha is a space for pure creative chaos.<br/>For her opening trick, Gelli Haha presents Switcheroo, the debut album via Innovative Leisure, to be released in June 2025. With a shared taste for off-kilter pop and vintage gear, producer Sean Guerin (of De Lux) joined Gelli in turning freshly-formed demos into a high-voltage experiment, abandoning meticulous structure for something freer and more electrifying. Every song on Switcheroo makes use of a myriad of recording toys; wacky analog effects, such as the Eventide Harmonizer, MXR Pitch Transposer, and various Electrix units, fashion an intentionally flawed and strictly silly texture throughout the album.<br/>Gelli Haha’s music thrives on duality: playful but profound, tongue-in-cheek but sincere. “Bounce House” is the child-like innocence; “Spit” is the S-words-only underground-club grit. “Piss Artist” revels in tequila-fueled storytelling about an infamous party moment (involving a jar — don’t ask, just dance), while “Normalize” feels like you’re stuck in Play-Doh.<br/>It’s a practice in play – recording vocals mid-jump, translating drum fills into mouth sounds, granting your best friend’s wish for a song about them. A bear attack crashes through the happy-go-lucky “Dynamite”, “Funny Music” ends with a sudden “BONK!”— because why not?<br/>The emotional rainbow stretches beyond the positive — Gelli pouts and wails on “Tiramisu”, demanding to know and feel everything, while “Pluto is not a planet it’s a restaurant” closes the album in a darker, heart-throbbing track with the repeated cry: “I’m afraid.”<br/>Switcheroo is the soundtrack to the Gelliverse, a sensory adventure sphere created by Gelli. This live revue is an invitation into a world of dolphin balloons, flutes, mini trampolines, and a stage bathed in the project’s primary color, red – bold and full of mischief.<br/>Gelli Haha isn’t foolproof. It’s by design. Switcheroo is an exercise in letting go, an inside joke turned theatrical spectacle. Participation is encouraged. Surrender is required.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Pollen<br/><br/>Thursday, April 02 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Rigometrics is making serious waves in the Northeast music scene with a dynamic, high-energy sound that blends the soul of classic rock with the grit of funk and blues, the hooks of indie, and the urgency of modern alternative. Their music fuses Josef Berger’s searing guitar work, Derek Haney’s hard-hitting, groove-driven drums, and Keenan Hendricks’ soaring vocals and swaggering piano, which doubles as the bass in their live setup, creating a genre-blurring style that feels both timeless and fresh. The result is a live experience and growing catalog that consistently draws in diverse audiences and fuels an ever-expanding, loyal fan base.<br/>Since forming in 2021, the three-piece has toured the East Coast and South ten times, sold out 300-cap venues, headlined major shows in Maine, and played over 350 gigs, entirely independently. Their catalog includes 2025’s Live in Maine II and single Couldn’t Tell Ya, 2024’s EP Elodie, live album Live in Maine, and singles Endless Road, All My Friends (Live for the Weekend), and No Smoke; 2023’s EP No Time to Waste and single Share the Fortune; and their 2022 debut album Rig N’ Roll. These projects are being shared through constant energetic live performances and an undeniable stage presence via a renovated school bus that the Rigometrics calls home when on the road.<br/>To bring these releases to life, Rigometrics collaborated with top-tier producers Jon Wyman, Matt Perry, and Anthony Gatti, as well as Grammy winners Dave Gutter, Adam Ayan, and ‘Bassy’ Bob Brockmann. Together, they crafted music that elevates Rigometrics’ signature sound while staying deeply rooted in the spirit of rock ‘n’ roll.<br/>LinkTree | Instagram | Spotify | TikTok | YouTube]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Saturday, April 25 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle<br/><br/>“It’s always been the case that everyone is going through something that you may not be aware of,” says the band’s Mac McCaughan. “This is currently more true than ever—but also the case that we are all going through some things together. In the face of that, what good is art and where is happiness found? (Spoiler alert: I don’t know.)”<br/>In seeking an answer, Songs in the Key of Yikes unleashes a sound that is triumphant and bright in the darkness, Majesty Shredding in overdrive. Lead single “Is It Making You Feel Something” sets the tone early with the band—McCaughan, Laura Ballance, Jim Wilbur, and Laura King—building an anthem out of the potential for joy, diving into slop-polluted waters (“now fakes are faking everything / that once made your poor heart sing”) and emerging with a pearl.<br/>“This song is about not second-guessing yourself in the very second-guessable process of writing words and music,” McCaughan explains. “It’s about the legitimate question of ‘who needs this and what is it good for?’ but also about not setting such a high bar for making art that you never get started. ‘Is it making you feel something?’ Ok, that’s a place to start.”<br/>Songs in the Key of Yikes is a signature Superchunk album: visceral and timeless and catchy as hell—a cathartic balm for these oppressive times that will feel even better once we’ve figured our collective shit out.<br/>Website | Facebook]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Rhineland<br/><br/>Saturday, February 21 - Doors: 7 pm : Show: 8 pm<br/>Cat’s Cradle Back Room<br/><br/>Since 2016, Vacation Manor combine an artful blend of eloquent lyricism, alternative experimentation, indie rock energy, and unassuming pop appeal. The duo—Nathan Towles [guitar, vocals] and Cole Young [drums]—have earned acclaim from American Songwriter, Atwood, and more. Now, they pull fans deeper into their embrace on their 2025 EP [Nettwerk].<br/>“We value people above all,” adds Nathan. “For us, our music is always better when we can involve our good friends in the process and experience something together. That in and of itself feels like a success for us.”<br/>This community grasped onto the music and never let go. Vacation Manor emerged with the Girl, Say EP highlighted by “Careless” and the breakout “A Toast and a Spirit.” The pair progressed over the course of Everything I Can’t Say Out Loud [2019] and Vacation Manor [2021]. Along the way, they toured alongside Briston Maroney and Night Traveler, in addition to performing at festivals such as Bright Shade Music & Arts Festival. The guys carefully assembled what would become the EP over two years. This time around, songs represented “different landmarks” in their shared and individual experiences. Recording out of a home studio in Virginia, Nathan and Cole self-produced the tracks, nodding to inspirations a la Oasis and The Sundays.<br/>In the end, Vacation Manor’s community will only continue to grow. “With anything we put out, we want to give people language to the things that they’re experiencing too,” Nathan leaves off. “It’s a way for us all to process life.”<br/>Website | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook]]></description>
